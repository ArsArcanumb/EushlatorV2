def correct_file(lines: List[str]) -> Tuple[List[str], bool]:
    """
    Apply manual replacements to a list of lines.

    Logic:
      - Only lines that (after strip) start with "set-string" and contain at least
        two quote characters (") are considered candidates.
      - The line is split by the quote character ("); the penultimate token
        `[-2]` is treated as the quoted text payload.
      - That payload is passed through `replace_str()`. If it changes, we
        substitute it back and mark that something was corrected.
      - All lines are returned with exactly one trailing newline preserved/added.

    Returns:
      (corrected_lines, anything_corrected)
        corrected_lines: the possibly edited lines (with trailing newlines normalized)
        anything_corrected: True iff at least one replacement was performed

    Notes / Assumptions:
      - This is a simple quote-splitting approach and assumes the payload does
        not contain escaped quotes that should remain inside the string. For
        example, a payload like:  "Hello \"world\""  would break this parser.
        The current logic intentionally does NOT handle escapingâ€”matching the
        original behavior.
